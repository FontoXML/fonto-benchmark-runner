This tool can measure the performance of a function and compare the performances of different functions in both NodeJS and in the browser. It takes Typescript files as input.

How to use:

- Create files in a performance folder in your project with names ending with .benchmark.ts
- Run `npx fonto-benchmark-runner` to run your performance tests in node.
